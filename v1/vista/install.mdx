You can install Vista via Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require nullaidev/vista
```

https://packagist.org/packages/nullaidev/vista

## Entry Point

Now, create a View and render it from your project main entry point, such as a typical `public/index.php`:

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
const NULLAI_VISTA_VIEWS_FOLDER = __DIR__ . '/views';

echo new \Nullai\Vista\View('home');
```

For each page you can provide a new view.
